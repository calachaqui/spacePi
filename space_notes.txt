*gps

##prorgess update
parts are all purchased and assembled
altimeter works for altitude and temprature
GPS works with python package gps but not with any UBLOX software
GPS also tracks altitude

Lora works but limited indoor range and untested outdoor range
antenna are purchased but unassembled

	#usage
	create a messaging system for sending the data and storing incase of LoRa failure
		first create program to just send data every 30 seconds logging to text, test it.
	- logging file or message database table
		
	- received messages logged or displayed
